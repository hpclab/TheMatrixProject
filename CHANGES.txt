Changes to the TheMatrix application

Up to 24/03/2014
- added all FLOAT comparison operators
- added String inequality comparison operators
- fixed string filters semantics wrt null (now synonymous of empty string)
- several modules fixed for postprocessing ( changeIput() related fixes)
- corrected sort crashing when using a custom iad path 
- results/ directory is now supported, files are properly searched for there and in iad/
- aggregate module fixed for corner cases (empty input, one input line...)
- several fixes to aggregate and aggregation functions to support correctly typed aggregation; 
  all subclasses complain for unacceptable types
-- Max Min support Float, Int, Boolean, Date types in input
-- Sum supports Float and Int
-- Avg and StDev support Float and Int, always return a Float; they both ignore missing/null values in input

Up to 30/01/14
- command line option --iadPath (experimental)
- aggregation functions now tolerate missing fields (under testing)
- added utility function division()
- bug corrected in ParametersModule 

Up to 19/01/14
- added utility functions round(), irandom(), frandom(), replace()
- reworked all two-input modules (product, merge, union) to solve a data passing bug

Up to 14/01/14
- added utility functions floor(), ceil()
- bugs fixed in utility functions Prod(), Year()
- new option, preliminary support of --iadPath (in testing, currently disabled in released build)
- new option --resultPath (experimental, disabled)
- solved problems with empty files and FileInput / FileOutput / ScriptFileInput

Up to 05/12/13
- ScriptFileInput now either passes parameters to nested scripts, or 
  opens the file with the results of the nested script (if existing).
- Command line options are now case-sensitive
- new command line option to dump the program graph in DOT format (graphviz) - experimental
- FileOutput saves the data schema to the xml descriptor (supports ScriptInput). 
  Changed behaviour with empty data streams (saves the header and overwrites the file anyway).
- FileInput has a bug concerning empty files (those with no data rows)

Up to 21/11/13
- removed bug with a single FileOutput in a script.

Up to 11/11/13
- added DropModule
- added Prod function
- restored compatibility with 32bit Java for sorting very long files

Up to 06/11/13
- added slower copy file that is safe for 32bit JVMs

Up to 24/10/13
- MySQL support working
- fixed bug crashing on missing xml files
- pushed voidmapping fix to all other DBMS
- added lookup tables compatibility with 9- and 10-digits Product AIFA codes; dotted and plain PROC_CODs
- ProductModule now working
- fixed resident IAD schema
- removed mapping examples from Distribution

Up to 27/09/13
- Fixes to MySQL adapter and VoidMapping implementation

Up to 17/09/13
- Adding support for MySQL (still in alpha testing): does streaming query results, sets null date preferences.
- Bug fixes in utility functions.

Up to 10/09/13
- External sorting subroutine replaced, now MatrixSort correctly works on files much larger than the JVM heap memory.

Up to 06/09/13
- Fixes to aggregate, changes to sort logging and debug

Up to 04/09/13
- Sorting now uses NIO to copy files (will skip copy at all when FileSorter is replaced)
- Several fixes to sort (maximum file number for merge, use of memory, frequency of memory checks)

Up to 30/07/13
- Added new functions for lookUp tables: Atc, Duration, TypeOFWard, TypeOfFullWard, TypeOfProc (under testing)
- Changes to the FileSorter (debugging stall on very large files)

Up to 21/07/13
- Compression on intermediate script buffers can now be enabled in settings.xml (defaults off)
- "0000-00-00" is accepted as synonym of unknown date in a CSV, i.e. missing
- Added memory usage information to the timeline.txt log file. Look for MEMSTAT lines.

Up to 19/07/13
- Bug fix in aggregate.sum for float values
- Bug fixes in boolean comparison functions (LessThan, GreaterThan, EqualsTo, NotEqual)
- Bug fixes in DBMS download code (stop running when mapping headers fails)
- Separate log file is now kept for configuration and data problems: data_errors.text 
- Now cleans log files at each run
- Compressed read/writes is still experimental

Up to 12/07/13
- Support for compressed reading/writing (experimental)
- Reduced debugging logs.

Up to 10/07/13
- Added (after test and debug) functionality for transparently buffering data in between modules 
  if needed by the script structure
- Multiple outputs form the same script work correctly (note that: you need to add each OutputModule in the 
  script in this case, explicitly)
- Corrected a bug in the Aggregate Module which was losing the last row of the input
- The script scriptSperimentazione130623.txt is working correctly on all indicators and 
  produces the same result as Stata on the test dataset

Up to 27/06/13
- Added modules for implicit data buffering to multiple modules (still in testing).

Up to 06/06/13
- Corrections to the types of a few IAD data fields: HOSP.

Up to 24/05/13
- Changes to error detection and exception handling: stronger checks 
  on mapping file contents and on errors in the DBMS interaction

Up to 20/05/13
- Reworked file saving to use both the iad and results subdirectories. Default is still to use iad. 
- Booleans are now written in CSV as 0/1 (and parsed both as integers and Java-style); 
- Corrected behaviour of some date/boolean functions when provided missing values
- Sanity checks are performed on the mapping configuration.
- Declare Schema added to scripting language
- FileOutput module added to language (optional, only one per script allowed)

Up to 26/04/2013
- Corrected RenameAttributes (tested, working)
- Corrected errors in RenameDataset (tested, working)
- Added Union module (tested, working)
- Corrected schema changing via command line parameters (modified initialization)
- Added esteem of the schema size once output to csv (very rough).

Before 12/04/2013

- Function names in the ApplyFunction module are now case-insensitive
- Added RenameDataset (to be tested)
- Added RenameAttributes module (incomplete implementation) 
- Added Sum function  
- Added support for multiple IAD built-in schemas (command line param. --fullIADschema )
- Corrected support for Microsoft SQLserver. Added some support for SAS (incomplete)
- Added VoidMapping tag in the configuration file mapping.xml

File restarted on 11/04/2013 to keep track of changes for upcoming release
